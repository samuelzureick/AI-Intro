These are labs I took part in for my introduction to AI coursework.

The Visual SLAM branch is an implimentation of visual slam that uses visual odometry to track the coordinates of a car and draw them too a map using a visual input.

The Reversi lab branch is a java implimentation of Othello that uses minmiax search with alpha-beta pruning in order to make moves.
